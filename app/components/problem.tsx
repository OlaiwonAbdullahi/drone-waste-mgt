        The Challenge with Todayâ€™s Waste Management
      </h2>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-center px-8  md:px-0">
        In traditional waste management systems, the process of waste
        collection, segregation, and recycling is often inefficient,
        time-consuming, and prone to errors. Additionally, inadequate waste
        disposal practices contribute to environmental pollution and hinder
        recycling initiatives. To address these challenges, we have developed
        the Drone Waste Management System.
